# VisionAI: AI-Powered Eye Disease Analysis

VisionAI is an AI-powered system designed for eye disease detection, diagnosis, and clinical decision support. It leverages deep learning techniques to analyze eye images and identify potential diseases with high accuracy, assisting healthcare professionals in early detection and effective treatment planning.

## Features
- Deep Learning-Based Diagnosis: Uses EfficientNetB3 for high-accuracy predictions.
- Image Preprocessing & Segmentation: Enhances image quality and isolates key regions.
- Multi-Class Classification: Detects multiple eye diseases from retinal images.
- Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes predictions and confidence scores.
- Clinical Decision Support: Helps ophthalmologists with automated insights.
