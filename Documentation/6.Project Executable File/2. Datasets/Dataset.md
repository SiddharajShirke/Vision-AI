# Kaggle Datasets of Eye Disese Detection by Deep Learning
Due to the restriction of the size of the file on Git-Hub we are unable 
to upload the training & testing datasets which is used to train the 
model of eye disease detection using deep learning. So, we are 
extremely sorry for that. We have used the Kaggle Datasets for the 
training, testing & validation of the model. We have attached the link 
of that datasets. 

Here is the Kaggle Datasets Link
